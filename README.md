Really, really early game storage in Minecraft

This mod consists of 3 new barrels: one with 1x9 slots, one with 2x7 slots, and one with 2x9 slots.

These are intended for modpacks that need some limited form of early game storage.

All barrels come with recipes but it is recommended the modpack dev add their own as there currently isn't much incentive to use these barrels.

A massive shoutout to the Metal Barrels mod, which provided the base code that made this possible.
